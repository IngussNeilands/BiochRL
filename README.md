#_FirstCPPApplication_

This is a Roguelike made with Libtcod, and is also my first experience using C++.

It's too early to have a distinct direction for the game, but I want to be able to say its 'finished', so what I'd like to add for now is:

* 3 items of all slot types
* 6 monster types with their own drop rates
* a random dungeon generation with at least 2 room types, square and round
* levelling and experience
* finally, some sort of over the top stat tracking

There's a screenshot in the directory
