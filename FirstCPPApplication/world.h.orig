So the idea here is to have a world, which is a navigatable set of
"maps", which are grids, 2-dimensional array of "tiles." A (one
dimensional) array of maps would be created, and special "warp" tiles
on these maps would be used to send the player from one map to another.

class Tile
{
	public:
		bool collidable;		// whether or not this tile cannot be walked on
		char representation;	// the character that represents this tile
		int warpMap;			// if this is a warp tile, index of the map to warp to
		int type;				// type of tile
		char *description;      // the description of the tile
        Person *occupant;       // the dude sitting on the tile
        bool fighter;
};


// in order to properly draw the player, i'm going to store
// whats under the player in tempchar
