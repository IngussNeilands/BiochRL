This is a Roguelike made with Libtcod, and is also my first experience using C++.

Currently, you can kill monsters, open doors, pick items up, and eat corpses for
better health regeneration. You're also able to cast a spell, level up, drink
potions, go up and down floors, talk to villagers, and use your mouse in your
inventory screen.

It's too early to have a distinct direction for the game, but I want to be able to say its 'finished', so what I'd like to add for now is:

* ~~3 items of all slot types~~
* ~~6 monster types with their own drop rates~~
* ~~a random dungeon generation with at least 2 room types, square and round~~
* ~~levelling and experience~~
* some sort of over the top stat tracking

New goals:

* selling inventory
* going back up floors
* add a close range spell, a healing spell, and a buff spell
* spell selection screen, character viewing screen
