This is a Roguelike made with Libtcod, and is also my first experience using C++.

Currently, you can kill monsters (with champions and a final boss), open (and
close) doors, pick items up (and drop them), and eat corpses for better health
regeneration. You're also able to cast a few different spells, level up (and
gain stat attributes), drink potions, go down floors, talk to villagers, and
use your mouse in your inventory screen.

It's too early to have a distinct direction for the game, but I want to be able to say its 'finished', so what I'd like to add for now is:

* ~~3 items of all slot types~~
* ~~6 monster types with their own drop rates~~
* ~~a random dungeon generation with at least 2 room types, square and round~~
* ~~levelling and experience~~
* ~~add a close range spell~~, ~~a healing spell,~~ and ~~a buff spell~~
* ~~spell selection screen~~, ~~character viewing screen~~

New goals:

* choosing some information on game load
* selling inventory
* going back up floors
* some sort of over the top stat tracking
* different environments. There's just dull brown now
* throwing items
* enemies who can throw/cast
