This is a Roguelike made with Libtcod. It is also my first experience with C++.

Currently, you can:
* Kill monsters including champions and a final boss.
* Open and close doors.
* Pick up and drop items.
* Eat corpses for better health regeneration.
* You're also able to cast a few different spells.
* Level up and gain stat attributes.
* Drink potions.
* Go down floors.
* Talk to villagers.
* Use your mouse in your inventory screen.

It's too early to have a distinct direction for the game, but I want to be able to say it's 'finished', so what I'd like to add for now is:

* ~~3 items of all slot types~~
* ~~6 monster types with their own drop rates~~
* ~~a random dungeon generation with at least 2 room types, square and round~~
* ~~levelling and experience~~
* ~~add a close range spell~~, ~~a healing spell,~~ and ~~a buff spell~~
* ~~spell selection screen~~, ~~character viewing screen~~

New goals:

* Choosing some information on game load.
* Selling inventory.
* Going back up floors.
* Some sort of over the top stat tracking.
* ~~different environments. There's just dull brown now~~
* Throwing items.
* Enemies who can throw/cast.
