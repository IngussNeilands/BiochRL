This is a Roguelike made with Libtcod, and is also my first experience using C++.

Currently, you can kill monsters, open doors, pick items up, and eat corpses for better health regeneration.

It's too early to have a distinct direction for the game, but I want to be able to say its 'finished', so what I'd like to add for now is:

* 3 items of all slot types
* 6 monster types with their own drop rates
* a random dungeon generation with at least 2 room types, square and round
* levelling and experience
* finally, some sort of over the top stat tracking
