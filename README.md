###Instructions
So the game is *hyper* unfinished, but it is beatable, by killing the Bad Mother on floor 5 or later. You can hit `?`for a list of commands, but the keypad or arrows to move around and attack people. I really recommend attacking only one or two enemies at a time, because any more than that, before you get any items, they will kill you. Oh, `,` (comma) to pick up an item, and `.` to pick one one and equip or use it, depending on the type.

Other commands that you'll need are `i` for your inventory, `m`for magic and `c` for your character sheet, or `p` to switch classes (this is the screen the game opens up on.

You can hit `q` to exit out of any screen, while `Esc` will pause the game and expect a `y` in the terminal to exit the game. While you're in a screen, you can press `a` twice to select and activate the first item (be it a class, a spell, or an item, depending on the screen), or `b` for the second, `c` for the third etc. 

Everything else below is extra info you probably won't need if you play at first (people tend to last 50 turns at most when they start out)

###Advanced Instructions

Once you've started the game, or pressed `p` from the main menu: you've got an class selected (ie pressing `a` once, moving the cursor onto the first item) and activated(ie pressing `b` a second time, changing the class' color), you can press `e` to 'equip' the class.

After pressing `i` to open your inventory from the game screen, select and activate an item, and press `e` to equip, `u` to use, `z` to zap (cast the spell that its enchanted with), `x` to examine, `y` to unquip, `d` to drop it.

After pressing `m` from the gamescreen, you'll be shown all your spells (none at level 1). Once you've selected and activated a spell (`aa`, `bb`, `cc` etc), you can press `c` to start casting. You can use the arrow keys to move around the casting reticule over an enemy to cast a spell with `k`.

Spells are automatically assigned to keys 1 through 5 for convenience as you level up. You can press backtick, `` ` ``, to see the ones currently bound.
